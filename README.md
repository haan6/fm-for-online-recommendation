# SILAB-Online-Recommendation

This project compares the recent reseach of the online Factoriztiaon machine for regression and classficatino task. We figure out the pros and cons for recent research. We will propose the revised model to overcome the limitation of online factorization machince.

This package has code for simulating and performing inference in a variety of factorization machines.


## Online Models
Online models take single data as an input, make a prediction, and train with the data.
* Online Factorization Machine
* Online Deep Factorization Machine
* Online Neural Factorization Machine
* Online Deep Factorization Machine with Hedge Backpropagation
* Online Neural Factorization Machine with Hedge Backpropagation


## Naive Models
Naive models take a batch of data as an input and train with the data. After traversing all the batches, naive models 
* Factorization Machine
* Deep Factorization Machine
* Neural Factorization Machine
* Attentional Factorization Machine
